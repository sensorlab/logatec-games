## Introduction
This package provides Python *.py files for conductiong a simple power allocation game between two players (four nodes) located in a VESNA-based wireless sensor network that uses ALH protocol in order to communicate. (link to LOG-a-TEC portal can be found [here](http://www.log-a-tec.eu/) - you need a username and password in order to have access to the testbed).

This code has been used for the findings reported in the following publication. Please cite this [publication]  (http://sensorlab.ijs.si/files/publications/Anton_Power_Allocation_Game_Logatec_2014_corrected.pdf) in your work.

Before using this package, please install VESNA ALH Tools and Python bindings for VESNA spectrum sensor application. In order to do this, please follow the steps described here:

* 1) **Installation of VESNA ALH Tools**
(see its own README file for installation instructions - _Tomaz Solc_ )
* https://github.com/avian2/vesna-alh-tools
* 2) **Installation of Python bindings for VESNA spectrum application** 
(see its own README file for installation instructions - _Tomaz Solc_ )
* https://github.com/sensorlab/vesna-spectrum-sensor
* 3) **pykalman, the dead-simple Kalman Filter, Kalman Smoother, and EM library for Python**
* https://github.com/pykalman/pykalman

**This package contains the following Python classes:**
* **Node** - used for setting the nodes as transmitters or receivers
* **Player** - contains information about the player, such as: channel gains, costs, player number (ID), noise power.
* **PlayerApp** - used as an application for sending packets (generating signal).
* **PowerAllocation** - used for determining the power that need to be allocated for each player. It contains three types of implementation (gameType) mentioned in Wiki "Power Allocation Game in a Real Scenario. The case of PAPU in LOG a TEC".
* **gainCalculations** - used for performing channel gain measurements.
* **Noise** - used for measuring the noise power.
* **Plot** - used for plotting the results.
* **livePlot** - live demo of the game
* **bestResponseAnalysis** - used for analysing the behaviour of the best response as a function of different parameters.
* **Kalmanimplementation** - used for implementing the Kalman Filter
* **MyQueue** - use as a queue of channel gains and best responses.
* **Iterations** - used for plotting algorithm's interations.
* **PlotNashEquilibriums** - used for plotting player strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------

* **gainMeasurementExample** - used as an example on how to perform channel gain measurements.
* **gameExample** - used as an example on how to run the game.




In the power allocation game, each player has two layers:
